# Win + R Plus for Linux

This project is derived from [StudentMain](https://github.com/studentmain)
[WinR](https://github.com/StudentMain/WinR).

This programme will try to provide the same experiece like previous one,
but currently, this is still under early-stage development. (i.e. it does
**NOT** work now!)

New WinR++ now is implemented under C++ and Qt technology which will have
better support in some platform (I guess, who knows?)

A keyboard shortcut is also recommended to be added (yes, that one,
`<super>+r`).
